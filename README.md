AEDAT parses event-based dynamic-vision system (DVS) data from an input source and streams it to a sink (see table below).

## Installation

AEStream can be installed with the Python package manage `pip`.
However, **AEStream depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [libcaer](https://gitlab.com/inivation/dv/libcaer/)**, so please install that manually **before** you install AEStream.
For PyTorch, recall whether you are using the CPU or CUDA version and use the corresponding command below to install AEStream:

| **PyTorch version** | **Command** |
| -------------------- | --- |
| With CPU | `pip install aestream --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu ` |
| With CUDA | `pip install aestream --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116` |

Note that this uses CUDA 11.6. Other versions can be found and used by copying links from [the website of PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

We do not currently support other platforms than Linux, but contributions are most welcome.

## Usage (Python)

The Python API exposes two classes for reading DVS data sources into PyTorch tensors: `USBInput` and `UDPInput`.

```python
# Stream events from a DVS camera over USB
with USBInput((640, 480)) as stream:
    while True:
        frame = stream.read() # Provides a (640, 480) tensor
        ...
```

```python
# Stream events from UDP port 3333 (default)
with UDPInput((640, 480), port=3333) as stream:
    while True:
        frame = stream.read() # Provides a (640, 480) tensor
        ...
```

More examples can be found in [our example folder](https://github.com/norse/aestream/tree/master/example).
Please note the examples may require additional dependencies (such as [Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) for spiking networks or [PySDL](https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2) for rendering). To install all the requirements, simply stand in the `aestream` root directory and run `pip install -r example/requirements.txt`

## Usage (CLI)

Installing AEStream also gives access to the command-line interface (CLI) `aestream`.
To use `aestraem`, simply provide an `input` source and an optional `output` sink (defaulting to STDOUT):

```bash
aestream input <input source> [output <output sink>]
```
## Supported Inputs and Outputs

| Input | Description | Usage |
| --------- | :----------- | ----- |
| DAVIS, DVXPlorer | [Inivation](https://inivation.com/) DVS Camera over USB | `input inivation` |
| EVK Cameras      | [Prophesee](https://www.prophesee.ai/) DVS camera over USB  | `input prophesee` |
| File             | [AEDAT file format](https://gitlab.com/inivation/inivation-docs/blob/master/Software%20user%20guides/AEDAT_file_formats.md) as `.aedat` or `.aedat4` | `input file x.aedat4` |

| Output | Description | Usage |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| STDOUT    | Standard output (default output) | `output stdout`
| Ethernet over UDP | Outputs to a given IP and port using the [SPIF protocol](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/spif)  | `output udp 10.0.0.1 1234` |
| `.aedat4` file  | Output to [`.aedat4` format](https://gitlab.com/inivation/inivation-docs/blob/master/Software%20user%20guides/AEDAT_file_formats.md#aedat-40) | `output file my_file.aedat4` |
| CSV file       | Output to comma-separated-value (CSV) file format | `output file my_file.txt` |

### CLI examples

| Example | Syntax |
| ------------- | ------------------------------|
| Read file to STDOUT | `aestream input file example/davis.aedat4` |
| Stream DVS Davis346 (USB 0:2) by iniVation AG to STDOUT (Note, requires Inivation libraries) | `aestream input inivation output stdout` |
| Stream Prophesee 640x480 (serial Prophesee:hal_plugin_gen31_fx3:00001464) to STDOUT (Note, requires Metavision SDK) | `aestream input output stdout` |
| Read file to remote IP X.X.X.X | `aestream input file example/davis.aedat4 output udp X.X.X.X` |

## Custom installation (C++)

AEStream requires [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html). [Metavision SDK](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/metavision_sdk/index.html) and [libcaer](https://github.com/inivation/libcaer) are optional dependencies, but are needed for connecting to Prophesee and Inivation cameras respectively.

AEStream is based on [C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20). Since C++20 is not yet fully supported by all compilers, we recommend using `GCC >= 10.2`. 

To build the binaries of this repository, run the following code:
```
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=`absolute path to libtorch/`
# Optional: Ensure paths to libcaer, Metavision, or OpenCV is in place
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
```

If your default C++ compiler doesn't support C++ 20, you will have to install an up-to-date compiler and provide the environmental variable `CXX`.
For instance like this: `CXX=/path/to/g++ cmake -GNinja ..`

### Inivation cameras
For [Inivation](https://inivation.com/) cameras, the [libcaer](https://gitlab.com/inivation/dv/libcaer/) library needs to be available, either by a `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` flag to `cmake` or included in the `PATH` environmental variable.
For examble: `cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libcaer`.
Inivation made the library available for most operating systems, but you may have to build it yourself.

### Prophesee cameras
For [Prophesee](https://www.prophesee.ai/) cameras, a version of the [Metavision SDK](https://www.prophesee.ai/metavision-intelligence/) needs to be present.
The open-source version the SDK `openeb` is available with installation instructions at https://github.com/prophesee-ai/openeb.
Using `openeb`, it should be sufficient to install it using `cmake && make && make install` to put it in your path.
Otherwise, you can point to it using the `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` option in `cmake`.
