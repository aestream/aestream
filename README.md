AEStream efficiently reads sparse events from an input source and streams it to an output sink.
AEStream supports reading from files, USB cameras, as well as network via UDP and can stream events to files, network over UDP, and peripherals such as [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit)s and [neuromorphic hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering).

## Installation

AEStream is usable both as a command-line binary or Python tool.

| **Source** | **Installation** |
| -------------------- | --- |
| [pip](https://pypi.org/) | <code>pip install aestream <br/> pip install aestream[torch]</code> ([PyTorch support](https://pytorch.com)) |
| [nix](https://nixos.org/) | <code>nix run github:norse/aestream</code> (CLI) <br/> <code>nix develop github:norse/aestream</code> (Python environment) |
| [docker](https://docker.com/) | See [Installation documentation](https://norse.github.io/aestream/install.html) |

Contributions to support AEStream on additional platforms are always welcome.

## Usage: read event-address files in Python

AEStream can process fixed input sources like files like so:

```python
FileInput("file", (640, 480)).load()
```

## Usage: stream real-time data in Python
AEStream also supports streaming data in real-time *without strict guarantees on orders*. 
This is particularly useful in real-time scenarios, for instance when operating with `USBInput` or `UDPInput`

```python
# Stream events from a DVS camera over USB
with USBInput((640, 480)) as stream:
    while True:
        frame = stream.read() # Provides a (640, 480) tensor
        ...
```

```python
# Stream events from UDP port 3333 (default)
with UDPInput((640, 480), port=3333) as stream:
    while True:
        frame = stream.read() # Provides a (640, 480) tensor
        ...
```

More examples can be found in [our example folder](https://github.com/norse/aestream/tree/master/example).
Please note the examples may require additional dependencies (such as [Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) for spiking networks or [PySDL](https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2) for rendering). To install all the requirements, simply stand in the `aestream` root directory and run `pip install -r example/requirements.txt`

### Example: real-time edge detection with spiking neural networks

![](example/usb_edgedetection.gif)

We stream events from a camera connected via USB and process them on a GPU in real-time using the [spiking neural network library, Norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) using fewer than 50 lines of Python.
The left panel in the video shows the raw signal, while the middle and right panels show horizontal and vertical edge detection respectively.
The full example can be found in [`example/usb_edgedetection.py`](https://github.com/norse/aestream/blob/main/example/usb_edgedetection.py)

## Usage (CLI)

Installing AEStream also gives access to the command-line interface (CLI) `aestream`.
To use `aestraem`, simply provide an `input` source and an optional `output` sink (defaulting to STDOUT):

```bash
aestream input <input source> [output <output sink>]
```
## Supported Inputs and Outputs

| Input | Description | Usage |
| --------- | :----------- | ----- |
| DAVIS, DVXPlorer | [Inivation](https://inivation.com/) DVS Camera over USB | `input inivation` |
| EVK Cameras      | [Prophesee](https://www.prophesee.ai/) DVS camera over USB  | `input prophesee` |
| File             | [AEDAT file format](https://gitlab.com/inivation/inivation-docs/blob/master/Software%20user%20guides/AEDAT_file_formats.md) as `.aedat`, `.aedat4`, or `.dat` | `input file x.aedat4` |

| Output | Description | Usage |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| STDOUT    | Standard output (default output) | `output stdout`
| Ethernet over UDP | Outputs to a given IP and port using the [SPIF protocol](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/spif)  | `output udp 10.0.0.1 1234` |
| `.aedat4` file  | Output to [`.aedat4` format](https://gitlab.com/inivation/inivation-docs/blob/master/Software%20user%20guides/AEDAT_file_formats.md#aedat-40) | `output file my_file.aedat4` |
| CSV file       | Output to comma-separated-value (CSV) file format | `output file my_file.txt` |

### CLI examples

| Example | Syntax |
| ------------- | ------------------------------|
| Echo file to STDOUT | `aestream input file example/sample.aedat4` |
| Stream DVS cameara from iniVation AG to STDOUT (Note, requires Inivation libraries) | `aestream input inivation output stdout` |
| Stream DVS camera from Prophesee to STDOUT (Note, requires Metavision SDK) | `aestream input output stdout` |
| Read file to remote IP X.X.X.X | `aestream input file example/sample.aedat4 output udp X.X.X.X` |

## Custom installation (C++)

[Metavision SDK](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/metavision_sdk/index.html) and [libcaer](https://github.com/inivation/libcaer) are optional dependencies, but are needed for connecting to Prophesee and Inivation cameras respectively.

AEStream is based on [C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20). Since C++20 is not yet fully supported by all compilers, we recommend using `GCC >= 10.2`. 

To build the binaries of this repository, run the following code:
```
# Optional: Ensure paths to libcaer or Metavision are in place
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
```

If your default C++ compiler doesn't support C++ 20, you will have to install an up-to-date compiler and provide the environmental variable `CXX`.
For instance like this: `CXX=/path/to/g++-10 cmake -GNinja ..`

### Inivation cameras
For [Inivation](https://inivation.com/) cameras, the [libcaer](https://gitlab.com/inivation/dv/libcaer/) library needs to be available, either by a `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` flag to `cmake` or included in the `PATH` environmental variable.
For examble: `cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/libcaer`.
Inivation made the library available for most operating systems, but you may have to build it yourself.

### Prophesee cameras
For [Prophesee](https://www.prophesee.ai/) cameras, a version of the [Metavision SDK](https://www.prophesee.ai/metavision-intelligence/) needs to be present.
The open-source version the SDK `openeb` is available with installation instructions at https://github.com/prophesee-ai/openeb.
Using `openeb`, it should be sufficient to install it using `cmake && make && make install` to put it in your path.
Otherwise, you can point to it using the `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` option in `cmake`.
